# Tips and Troubleshooting 

### Always `ACPI Shutdown`, never `Poweroff`!

* The Virtualbox menu has two options: `Machine > Poweroff` and `Machine > ACPI Shutdown`. 
* `ACPI Shutdown` is the _right way_ to shutdown the Android VM. It is equivalent to long-pressing the power button.
* `Poweroff` on the other hand, wipes out all your initial setup and installed apps, and takes you back to the Initial Setup screen.
